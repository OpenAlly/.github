**OpenAlly** is an opiniated initiative born from the ashes of [SlimIO](https://github.com/SlimIO).
We are a group of open-source contributors dedicated to building valuable **tools** and fostering a **community** that benefits developers, primarily in JavaScript.

To achieve this, we have formed an alliance to **mutualize value and expertise** across several distinct projects and organizations. One of our core concepts is to create a family of tools that provide complementary functionality and support each other.

Members of the alliance focus on broader challenges, including:
- Ensuring the safety of projects and their dependencies.
- Engaging and supporting new contributors.
- Seeking sponsors and funding opportunities.

While our strength lies in creating free tools, OpenAlly is also committed to exploring sustainable financial models for our members, ensuring the longevity and impact of our initiatives.

Join us in our mission to build a collaborative and supportive ecosystem for developers!

## Members

Members are organizations that contribute to this initiative. Each one helps shape the identity and image of the OpenAlly project, which can only exist through the **contract** that **binds** them all together.
