**OpenAlly** is an opiniated initiative born from the ashes of [SlimIO](https://github.com/SlimIO).
We are open source contributors with the desire to build **tools** and a **community** that bring value to developers (mainly in JavaScript to date).

To this end we have built an alliance to **mutualize value and expertise** between several distinct projects and organizations.
One of the key ideas is to be able to build a **family of tools** that will provide functionality and support to each other.

The alliance members will *support* broader challenges such as:
- Ensuring the safety of projects and their dependencies.
- Help to engage new contributors.
- Searching for sponsors and funding.

Even though our strength lies in creating free tools, OpenAlly has the **hope** to find sustainable financial models for his members.

> **Note** We also have no intention of being more prominent than our member projects.

## Members

Members are organizations that **contribute** to this initiative. Each one constitutes the identity and the image of the OpenAlly project, which can only exist by the **contract** which **binds them all** together.
