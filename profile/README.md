**OpenAlly** is an opiniated and non-neutral project born from the ashes of [SlimIO](https://github.com/SlimIO).
We are open source contributors with the desire to build **tools** and a **community** that bring value to developers (mainly in JavaScript to date).

To this end we have built an alliance to **mutualize value** between several distinct projects and organizations.
One of the key ideas is to be able to build a **family of tools** that will provide functionality and support to each other.

The organization will *support* broader challenges such as:
- Building adequate project governance.
- Ensuring the safety of projects and their dependencies.
- Help to engage new contributors and help maintainers to reduce their mental and work load.
- Searching for sponsors and funding.

Even though our strength lies in creating free tools, OpenAlly **has no plans or will to restrict** organizations from developing a professional offer.

> **Note** We also have no intention of being more prominent than our member projects.
